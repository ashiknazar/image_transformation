    "# Pix2Pix: Image-to-Image Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Pix2Pix is a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed for image-to-image translation tasks using paired training data. Itâ€™s a powerful model for scenarios where you need to transform one type of image into another, such as converting a frontal scooter image into a driving view.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Pix2Pix Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Pix2Pix consists of two main components:\n",
    "- **Generator**: Creates an image from the input by learning to map the input image to the target output.\n",
    "- **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real images from the training set and generated images from the generator. The generator aims to fool the discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained in an adversarial fashion, where the generator tries to create realistic images, and the discriminator improves its ability to distinguish real from fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Workflow for Pix2Pix\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - **Collect Paired Images**: Ensure that you have images of the scooter from both frontal and driving angles. These images must be paired, meaning each input image corresponds directly to a target output image.\n",
    "   - **Preprocess Images**: Resize and normalize your images to a consistent size, typically 256x256 pixels for Pix2Pix. Normalize pixel values to the range [-1, 1] if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setting Up the Environment**:\n",
    "   - Install the required libraries:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     pip install tensorflow opencv-python\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Import necessary packages in Python:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "     import cv2\n",
    "     import numpy as np\n",
    "     import os\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Implementation**:\n",
    "   - You can either implement Pix2Pix from scratch using TensorFlow/PyTorch or use pre-built implementations available in libraries like `tensorflow_examples`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training the Pix2Pix Model**:\n",
    "   - **Generator and Discriminator Setup**: Define both networks. The generator typically uses a U-Net architecture, while the discriminator uses a PatchGAN.\n",
    "   - **Loss Functions**: Use the following losses:\n",
    "     - **Adversarial Loss**: Helps the generator create realistic images.\n",
    "     - **L1 Loss**: Encourages the generator to create images similar to the target output.\n",
    "   - **Training Loop**: Train the model using a combination of adversarial and L1 losses. Use a batch size that fits into your GPU memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sample Code to Train Pix2Pix**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Example of loading and preparing your dataset\n",
    "   def load_image(image_path):\n",
    "       image = cv2.imread(image_path)\n",
    "       image = cv2.resize(image, (256, 256))\n",
    "       image = (image / 127.5) - 1  # Normalize to [-1, 1]\n",
    "       return image\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Load paired images\n",
    "   input_image = load_image('path/to/frontal_image.jpg')\n",
    "   target_image = load_image('path/to/driving_angle_image.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Pix2Pix model (using TensorFlow or a pre-built library)\n",
    "   from tensorflow_examples.models.pix2pix import pix2pix\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Initialize and compile the model\n",
    "   generator = pix2pix.unet_generator(3, norm_type='batchnorm')\n",
    "   discriminator = pix2pix.discriminator()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Define optimizers and loss functions\n",
    "   generator_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(2e-4, beta_1=0.5)\n",
    "   discriminator_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(2e-4, beta_1=0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Training loop\n",
    "   for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n",
    "       # Load and preprocess your images in batches\n",
    "       # Train the generator and discriminator\n",
    "       pass  # Add your training code here\n"
