    "# Image Alignment and Perspective Transformation Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project transforms a source image to match the alignment and perspective of a \"driving\" image. By leveraging keypoints and image warping techniques, the source image is transformed to match the visual alignment of the driving image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract keypoints from the source and driving images.\n",
    "- Transform the source image to match the driving image’s pose, alignment, and perspective.\n",
    "- Output a single-frame result with the adjusted source image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keypoint Detection**: Use a keypoint detection model (e.g., MediaPipe or OpenPose) to find structural points on both images.\n",
    "2. **Affine and Perspective Transformation**: \n",
    "   - Use affine transformations for rotation, scaling, and translation.\n",
    "   - Apply a homography for perspective transformation to match 3D perspective.\n",
    "3. **Single-Frame Motion Model (Alternative)**: \n",
    "   - Extract feature maps from source and driving images and apply single-frame warping based on the first-order motion model.\n",
    "4. **Depth Adjustment (Optional)**: \n",
    "   - Use depth estimation to apply realistic 3D transformations if the driving image’s viewpoint differs significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Required Libraries**: Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "2. **Keypoint Detection**: Detect keypoints in both images.\n",
    "3. **Calculate Transformations**: Compute an affine or perspective transformation matrix.\n",
    "4. **Warp Source Image**: Apply the transformation matrix to match the driving image’s perspective.\n",
    "5. **Save Output**: Output the transformed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python** with libraries: OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyTorch (optional), and SciPy.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Running the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the Script**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python main.py --source path/to/source_image.jpg --driving path/to/driving_image.jpg --output path/to/output.jpg\n",
